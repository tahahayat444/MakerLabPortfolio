                        <p class="lead mb-5">Welcome to my portfolio! I am a second year international student at Wilfrid Laurier University 
                            pursuing an undergraduate degree in User Experience Design. I come from Pakistan. My interests and hobbies are 
                            playing the guitar, and studying history. My passion is to create good ergonomic design and eliminate bad design 
                            so people don't have bad experiences. The motivation to create good design comes from how I have encountered 
                            many bad designs throughout my life and find them irritating.

                            The task of the project was to make a physical box that has a function, is accessible, and “hacks” the traditional 
                            definition of a box. For this task, me and my group agreed on making a “grocery box” that allows users to have easier 
                            access to groceries. During this project, I was in charge of making the prototype and thus, was able to critically 
                            think and iterate as the final prototype was different from the one I started off with and what me and my group.

                    <!--a Description of the design problem (or problems) being addressed by these projects (~100 words)-->
                        <p class="lead mb-5">
                            The problem we chose was how most modern day grocery boxes lack accessibility features. There are many issues with 
                            accessibility with normal grocery boxes, such as people with physical impairments could struggle to open or move the 
                            box, or it could be too heavy for some people for other reasons. To tackle these issues, we came up with a few 
                            specifications: <br>
                            <b>• Wheels:</b> This allows for people to drag the box instead of holding it up, meaning the weight being carried by the 
                            person is drastically less. <br>
                            <b>• Dividers:</b> To prevent items from mixing with each other, there will be dividers for the user to organize their 
                            groceries. <br>
                            <b>• Waterproofing & insulation:</b> This will prevent the bag from getting drenched and potentially leaking liquid onto 
                            other items, and control the temperature for items that are hot/cold. <br>
                            <b>• Handle: </b>This improves the box's mobility and makes it more accessible to users.

                        </p>
                    <h3>Review of each step in the design process</h3>
                    <!--a Review of each step in the design process (~200 words)-->
                        <p class="lead mb-5">
                            <b>1. Brainstorming:</b> After the grocery box design was chosen, me and my group brainstormed the choice of materials, 
                            accessibility features and other details of the box, this brainstorming session opened up my mind to many new 
                            perspectives on accessible design. <br>
                            <b>2. Iterating:</b> After our initial design idea, our prototype underwent many changes and iterations. As I built it there 
                            were many times I had to figure out the most efficient design for wheel mechanics in order to ensure smooth moving, 
                            and tried different materials for insulation. These processes of iterating the prototype helped me understand the physical 
                            aspect of design and make much better design choices. <br>
                            <b>3. Final product:</b> Building the final product was overall a fun and educational experience and presenting the prototype was 
                            a great opportunity for feedback on our design.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Evaluation of the final design</h3>
                    <!--a Concluding Evaluation of the final design for the maker projects (~100 words)-->
                        <p class="lead mb-5">
                            The final design was a modified grocery box that had new accessibility features built in to help disabled people have an easier 
                            time using it. The handle, flaps and mobility in my opinion improve the box greatly but it could use better seals, temperature 
                            control features and warning labels to fully utilize the potential it has for accessibility and good design.

                    <h3>Summary of the project</h3>
                        <p class="lead mb-5">
                            The goal of the project was to create an educational game for children to help them learn proper waste disposal etiquette. 
                            For this project me and my group members decided on the idea for an educational game, I made the sketch and researched the 
                            connections to critical making for this project.

                    <h3>Description of the design problem</h3>
                        <p class="lead mb-5">
                            The design problem me and my group chose was the damage that improper waste disposal causes to the environment through 
                            pollution and overflowing landfills. This problem in our perspective can be cured by making an appealing and at the same 
                            time educational game for children to play in order to teach them how to properly recycle waste and be better overall 
                            citizens in their communities.

                    <h3>Review of each step in the design process</h3>
                        <p class="lead mb-5">
                            <b>1. Brainstorming: </b>After the idea for the game was chosen, me and my group brainstormed the choice of materials, aesthetic 
                            design, card structure and other details of this game. <br>
                            <b>2. Iterating: </b>I made the initial sketch for the game on Freeform and it was the starting point for our group. Unfortunately 
                            we could not make the prototype together but it underwent many changes and iterations with the final design separating 
                            the boxes representing the bins and giving them a more colorful and proper look as well as simplifying the design of 
                            the cards. <br>
                            <b>3. Final product: </b>The final product was an appealing set of game pieces including small sized garbage bins with labels and 
                            cards representing garbage. This was overall in my opinion an appealing looking game that children could play and learn 
                            from.

                        </p>
                    <h3>Evaluation of the final design</h3>
                        <p class="lead mb-5">
                            The final design included small cardboard garbage bins that had nice appealing color choices and proper designs. The cards 
                            included large images of garbage making it easy for children to identify what is what and where it belongs. The overall design was 
                            very good and served its purpose in design, aesthetic and educational features.

                    <span class="h1alt">Learnt</span>
                </h1>
                <h3>What did you accomplish through your involvement in the maker projects?</h3>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    I learnt collaborative skills and overcame many working challenges together with my group. I improved my 
                    making abilities e.g. cutting, designing etc as well as my sketching and brainstorming skills and managed 
                    to create designs and presentations with my group that I am proud of as well as gaining invaluable learning 
                    experiences and getting to see different perspectives.
                </p>
                <h3>What challenges did you and your group encounter?</h3>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    We encountered many challenges in terms of communication and expectations but through dialogue we managed 
                    to overcome these challenges and worked together smoothly.
                </p>
                <h3>What did you do differently to respond to these challenges?</h3>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    I chose to be calm, empathetic and hopeful which is not different but that approach helped me and my group 
                    members overcome challenges and work together to create the designs we planned out.</p>
                <h3>Which aspects of the design process worked, and why?</h3>
                <p class="lead mb-5">Researching, prototyping, sketching and brainstorming ideas worked well for me as 
                    researching the problem helped me understand it well. Prototyping worked well as I found the process fun 
                    and learnt a lot about making.
                </p>
                <h3>Which aspects of the design process did not work, and why?</h3>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    Some aspects of the prototyping did not work such as the wheels initially and their mechanics or the 
                    insulation not sticking properly but this was due to my own errors which after further tinkering I managed 
                    to solve.
                </p>
                <h3>What did you learn from your involvement in the design process?</h3>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    I learned how to do the actual making part of design as well as improving my brainstorming and sketching 
                    ability. I also learnt a lot of valuable lessons about accessibility and accessible designing.
                </p>
                <h3>How does the design process contribute to your evolution as a UX Designer?</h3>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    The design process helps me understand the physical aspects of design and approaching user experience 
                    from beyond just a digital aspect. This experience will undoubtedly make me a more versatile UX designer 
                    and thus has helped me evolve my skill set.
